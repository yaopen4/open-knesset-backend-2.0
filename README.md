# Open Knesset Backend

An open-source API providing access to Israeli Knesset (Parliament) data.

## What is this?

This project makes Israeli parliamentary data freely accessible to everyone. It provides a clean, organized way to access information about:

- **Members of Knesset** — Current and past representatives, their roles, and activities
- **Bills & Legislation** — Proposed laws, their status, and voting history
- **Votes** — How members voted on various issues
- **Committees** — Parliamentary committees and their work
- **Plenum Sessions** — Full assembly meetings and discussions
- **Laws** — Enacted legislation
- **Lobbyists** — Registered lobbyists and their activities

## Why does this matter?

Transparency in government is essential for democracy. This API enables:

- **Journalists** to investigate legislative patterns and voting behavior
- **Researchers** to analyze parliamentary data at scale
- **Civic organizations** to build tools that inform citizens
- **Developers** to create applications that make government more accessible
- **Citizens** to understand what their representatives are doing
